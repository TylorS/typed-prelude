# @typed/react

Useful hooks and other functions to bring Typed into the React ecosystem.

If you like hooks and TypeScript be sure to checkout these other libraries! I've tried not to overlap too much with other great TypeScript React hooks libraries already published with TypeScript types except where to make use of Typed functionality but does not have any non-Typed dependencies.

> If you would like to add your TypeScript React hooks library to this document feel free to open a PR adding it. 
> Please also ship an ES Module version of your libary from the `module` field in your `package.json` =)
