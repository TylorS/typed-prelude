# Typed 

> Reliable, standards-oriented software for browsers & Node. Designed for TypeScript and progressive web applications.

Typed is a TypeScript toolkit composed of many Ã -la-carte single purposed libraries to help build applications
that work in both browsers & Node. All Typed libraries are side-effect free, and provides a tree-shakable API around 
(mostly) curried functions and expressive data-types.

It's been a bit of a labor of love, and has evolved greatly as I (TylorS) have since beginning my engineering journey.
The collection of libraries attempts to find the sweet spot for functional programming (FP) APIs designed with TypeScript. While 
many FP libraries use obscure names and talk about monads and other categories directly, it has been mostly avoided here. Many of these 
concepts are *much* less complex when all you need to do is get your work done. In the future, I'll be working on many additional articles 
putting every library here into action individually, and we'll how they start to compose into highly-testable, reactive, and 
modular single-page applications.
