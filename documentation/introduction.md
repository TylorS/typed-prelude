# Typed 

> Reliable, standards-oriented software for browsers & Node. Designed for TypeScript and progressive web applications.

Typed is a TypeScript toolkit composed of many Ã -la-carte single purposed libraries to help build applications
that work in both browsers & Node. All Typed libraries are side-effect free, and provides a tree-shakable API around 
(mostly) curried functions and expressive data-types.

Only modern environments are supported out of the box. The last 2 major versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge are supported, as well as the lastest stable and long-term-support releases for Node. Lets keep the web improving.
