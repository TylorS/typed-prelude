# Typed

> Reliable software for browsers & Node. Designed for TypeScript and progressive web applications.

Typed is TypeScript toolkit composed of many Ã -la-carte single purposed libraries to help build applications
that work in both browsers & Node. With few [documented exceptions](#exceptions), all the Typed libraries have no non-Typed dependencies
are side-effect free, and provide a tree-shakable API around functions.
